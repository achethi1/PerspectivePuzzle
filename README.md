# PerspectivePuzzle
This puzzle can be used to examine the effects of perception on puzzle solving abilities. By offering two options for perspectives: allocentric (third person pov) and egocentric (first person pov), the player's problem solving capacities can be analyzed by using accuracy and time measurements.

The project was made during my time at the PEARL lab, which looks to research psychology topics through an engineering lens. I independently developed the code for this puzzle game on Unity, and recieved feedback from a mentor at our weekly meetings.

Finishing the puzzle requires the grid to be completely filled out with the puzzle pieces, similar to tetris. The player must approach each piece to move them around. A 2D array was used to track the grid's progress. There were two cameras created and positioned to allow for the switch in perspectives. A function was created to click puzzle pieces into place on the grid to increase user experience. Multiple libraries were used to add style effects to the game.
