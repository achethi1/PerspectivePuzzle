# PerspectivePuzzle
This puzzle can be used to examine the effects of perception on puzzle solving abilities. By offering two options for perspectives: allocentric (third person pov) and egocentric (first person pov), the player's problem solving capacities can be analyzed by using accuracy and time measurements.

The project was made during my time at the PEARL lab, which looks to research psychology topics through an engineering lens. I independently developed the code for this puzzle game, and recieved feedback from a mentor at our weekly meetings.
